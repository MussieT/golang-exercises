// If the workload that we want to parallelize is too small, meaning weâ€™re going to
// compute it too fast, the benefit of distributing a job across cores is destroyed: the time
// it takes to create a goroutine and have the scheduler execute it is much too high com-
// pared to directly merging a tiny number of items in the current goroutine. Although
// goroutines are lightweight and faster to start than threads, we can still face cases
// where a workload is too small.
